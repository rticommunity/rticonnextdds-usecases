// The manufacturing execution system interface provides lot plans
// over the network (or shared memory) to other applications that are interested 
// in monitoring the state of chocolate lots.  
//		
// Writing chocolate lot state data:
// ---------------------------------
// This application sends chocolate lot state data, configured to behave as 
// state data (or last-value cache).  This will reliably deliver each chocolate
// lot state update to both existing and late-joining applications that subscribe
// to chocolate lot state data.
//
// This application is responsible for sending the initial chocolate lot state
// update to announce that there is a new lot that needs to be processed by all
// of the controllers.
//
// For information on the chocolate lot state data type, please see the 
// ChocolateFactory.idl file.  
//
// For information on the quality of service for chocolate lot state data, 
// please see the recipe_profiles_multicast.xml or 
// recipe_profiles_no_multicast.xml file.
