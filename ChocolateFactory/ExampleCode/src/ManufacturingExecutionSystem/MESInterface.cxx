// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //
// The MESInterface is the network interface to the whole Manufacturing
// Execution System application.  This creates DataReaders and DataWriters
// in order to receive and send data.  
//
// This interface is built from:
// 1. Network data types and topic names defined in the IDL file
// 2. XML configuration files that describe the QoS profiles that should be 
//    used by individual DataWriters and DataReaders.  These describe the 
//    movement and persistence characteristics of the data (how reliable should
//    this be?), as well as other QoS such as resource limits.
// 3. The code itself creates DataReaders and DataWriters, and selects which 
//    profile to use when creating the DataReaders and DataWriters.
//
// Reading ChocolateLotState data:
// ------------------------------
// The Manufacturing Execution System listens to chocolate lot state data that 
// indicates the current location of the chocolate lot state according to each
// Station Controller.  
//
// !!!
// NOTE: This may receive updates about a chocolate lot state out of order,
// because the chocolate lot state is being updated by multiple applications
// that could reside on multiple machines.  Getting in-order data from multiple
// sources can be difficult, and may require finely-synchronized clocks on each
// machine.
// 
// Writing ChocolateLotState data:
// ----------------------------
// This application sends chocolate lot state data, using the announcement to 
// assign the chocolate lot to a particular controller.  This sets the 
// chocolate lot state to:
//    - Assigned to the next station controller.
// 
// For information on the ChocolateRecipe or ChocolateLotState types, please see the
// ChocolateFactory.idl file.  
//
// For information on the quality of service for state data, please see the 
// recipe_profiles_multicast.xml file.
//
//
// Quality of Service:
// -------------------
// All of the data in this example is modeled as "state data," which means that:
//   1. It is sent reliably (RELIABLE_RELIABILITY_QOS)
//   2. It is made available to late-joining applications as soon as they start
//      (TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS)
//   3. A predetermined amount of state is sent to any late-joiners.  In this 
//      case, applications are only interested in the current state of each
//      chocolate lot (or the current chocolate recipe), which translates to a
//      history with depth = 1, kind = KEEP_LAST_HISTORY_QOS
//
