// This example is using an application thread to be notified when chocolate

//    on the middleware's thread.  
//    This uses WaitSet objects to be notified of data arriving.
//    A simple of example of this can be found at: 
//    http://community.rti.com/examples/waitset-status-condition
// 2. Being notified in a listener callback of data arriving.
//    This has lower latency than using a WaitSet, but is more dangerous
//    because you have to worry about not blocking the middleware's thread.
// 3. Polling for data.
//    You can call read() or take() at any time to view or remove the data that
//    is currently in the queue. 
//    A simple example of this can be found at:
