// 
// This application creates a number of recipes that are available for, this
// factory, and sends them over the network.  It sends all of these recipes
// immediately using a design for state data.  This means that the recipes
// are available to any interested application as soon as that appliation
// starts up.
//
// The recipe data is modeled as RTI Connext DDS "state data," meaning:
//   1) the recipe is modeled to have a key field which differentiates 
//      individual recipes.  This key field is the recipe name.
//
//   and that it is sent:
//   1) Reliably
//   2) Durably - meaning that this application can send a recipe, and
//      even if the subscribing applications do not exist, yet, they will be
//      notified of all recipes as soon as they create the corresponding
//      DataReader.
//   3) With a history set to: kind = keep last, depth = 1.  This means that 
//      just the most recent update to each recipe will be sent to 
//      DataReaders at startup.  This means that it a recipe is updated, 
//      other applications will see only the updated recipe.
//      Note:  THIS HISTORY SETTING IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR STRICT RELIABLITY.
//      If you want to see all the updates to a particular recipe that have
//      ever been made, this setting should be changed to history= keep all.
//      The current setting guarantees delivery of the _most recent_ update
//      to the recipe.
