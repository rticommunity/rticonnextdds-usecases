// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The RecipePublisherInterface is the network interface to the whole
// application.  This creates a DataWriter in order to send recipe data
// over the network (or shared memory) to other applications that are
// interested in recipes.
//
// This interface is built from:
// 1. Network data types and topic names defined in the IDL file
// 2. XML configuration files that describe the QoS profiles that should be
//    used by individual DataWriters and DataReaders.  These describe the
//    movement and persistence characteristics of the data (how reliable should
//    this be?), as well as other QoS such as resource limits.
// 3. The code itself creates DataWriters, and selects which QoS profile to use
//    when creating the DataWriters.
//
// Writing recipe data:
// --------------------
// This application sends recipes, configured to act as state data
// (or last-value cache).  This will reliably deliver the recipes to both
// existing and late-joining applications that subscribe to recipes.
//
// For information on the recipe data type, please see the
// ChocolateFactory.idl file.
//
// For information on the quality of service for recipe state data, please
// see the recipe_profiles_multicast.xml or recipe_profiles_no_multicast.xml
// file.
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //

    // with the QoS library name and the QoS profile name are configured as

    // the .xml file. Look in the XML for more details on the definition of
    // state data.

    // unique recipe name

    // The recipe data has a very simple ID, and does not need high-
    // throughput, so we are not bothering to pre-register the instance
    // handle.  If we did pre-register the instance handle, this could
    // potentially speed up the writing.
