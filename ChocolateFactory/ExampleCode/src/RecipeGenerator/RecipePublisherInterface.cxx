// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The RecipePublisherInterface is the network interface to the whole 
// application.  This creates a DataWriter in order to send recipe data
// over the network (or shared memory) to other applications that are 
// interested in recipes.
//
// This interface is built from:
// 1. Network data types and topic names defined in the IDL file
// 2. XML configuration files that describe the QoS profiles that should be 
//    used by individual DataWriters and DataReaders.  These describe the 
//    movement and persistence characteristics of the data (how reliable should
//    this be?), as well as other QoS such as resource limits.
// 3. The code itself creates DataWriters, and selects which QoS profile to use
//    when creating the DataWriters.
// 
// Writing recipe data:
// --------------------
// This application sends recipes, configured to act as state data
// (or last-value cache).  This will reliably deliver the recipes to both
// existing and late-joining applications that subscribe to recipes.
//
// For information on the recipe data type, please see the 
// ChocolateFactory.idl file.  
//
// For information on the quality of service for recipe state data, please
// see the recipe_profiles_multicast.xml or recipe_profiles_no_multicast.xml 
// file.

	// Topics, etc.

	// Note: all data in this example is "state data."  The string constants with the

	// whether your application is reading or writing particular data, this

	// This topic has the name RECIPE_TOPIC - a constant  
	// string that is defined in the .idl file.  (It is not required that
