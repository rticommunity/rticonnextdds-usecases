// Writing recipe data:
// --------------------
// This application sends recipe data, configured to behave as state data
// (or last-value cache).  This will reliably deliver each recipe to both
// existing and late-joining applications that subscribe to recipes.
//
// For information on the recipe data type, please see the 
// ChocolateFactory.idl file.  
//
// For information on the quality of service for recipe state data, please
// see the recipe_profiles_multicast.xml or recipe_profiles_no_multicast.xml
