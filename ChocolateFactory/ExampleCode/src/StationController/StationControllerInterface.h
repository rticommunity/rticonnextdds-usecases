// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A station controller is responsible for:
//   1. Listing for chocolate lot state data that indicates it should be 
//      responsible for the next step in a chocolate recipe for a given lot.
//   2. Updating the chocolate lot state to indicate that it is processing a
//      lot, or to send the chocolate lot to the next station controller.
//
// The station controller interface is composed of two parts:  
//
// Reading ChocolateLotState data:
// ------------------------------
// The station controller listens to chocolate lot state data that indicates 
// that a chocolate lot is on the way to this station controller.
//
// It uses a DDS DataReader, with a content filter to receive only updates
// that indicate that it is the next station controller to process the lot.
// 
// Writing ChocolateLotState data:
// ----------------------------
// This application sends chocolate lot state data, announcing that the current
// lot of chocolates is either:
//   1. Waiting to be processed by this station controller
//   2. Being processed by this station controller
//   3. Done being processed by this station controller/ready to be processed
//      by the next station controller.
// 
// For information on the ChocolateRecipe or ChocolateLotState types, please see 
// the ChocolateFactory.idl file.  
//
// For information on the quality of service for state data, please see the 
// recipe_profiles_multicast.xml file.
//
// Reading Recipe data:
// --------------------
// This application reads recipe data to know which state controller to send
// the chocolate lot to when it is done.
//
// Quality of Service:
// -------------------
// All of the data in this example is modeled as "state data," which means that:
//   1. It is sent reliably (RELIABLE_RELIABILITY_QOS)
//   2. It is made available to late-joining applications as soon as they start
//      (TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS)
//   3. A predetermined amount of state is sent to any late-joiners.  In this 
//      case, applications are only interested in the current state of each
//      chocolate lot (or the current chocolate recipe), which translates to a
//      history with depth = 1, kind = KEEP_LAST_HISTORY_QOS
