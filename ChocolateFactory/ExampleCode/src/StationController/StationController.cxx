//
// Station Controller Application:
// This application acts as a "station controller" in a chocolate factory. Its
// purpose is to process a chocolate lot according to a recipe for the chocolate
// either dark chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate.
// 
// To "process" a lot, this application retrieves the recipe that this lot is
// using, and based on how much time the step should take, it sleeps.
//
// This application receives:
//     1. Recipe data: it receives recipes so it can get information on how to
//        process a particular lot.  (Note that this exmaple replaces real 
//        recipe information with how long to sleep)
//     2. Filtered chocolate lot state updates: this application creates a 
//        content-filtered topic, so it receives only updates about chocolate
//        lots that: 
//          a. Are assigned to it, or
//          b. Are completed (so it can unregister that lot)
// 
// This application sends:
//     1. Updates to a chocolate state saying either:
//          a. It is waiting at this station controller
//          b. This station controller is processing it
//          c. It is assigned to the next station controller in the recipe
//          d. It is completed (no more station controllers in the recipe)
//
