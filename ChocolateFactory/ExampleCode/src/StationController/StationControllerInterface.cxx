// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //
// The StationControllerInterface is the network interface to the whole 
// Station Controller application.  This creates DataReaders and DataWriters
// in order to receive and send data.  
//
// This interface is built from:
// 1. Network data types and topic names defined in the IDL file
// 2. XML configuration files that describe the QoS profiles that should be 
//    used by individual DataWriters and DataReaders.  These describe the 
//    movement and persistence characteristics of the data (how reliable should
//    this be?), as well as other QoS such as resource limits.
// 3. The code itself creates DataReaders and DataWriters, and selects which 
//    profile to use when creating the DataReaders and DataWriters.
//
// Reading ChocolateLotState data:
// ------------------------------
// The station controller listens to chocolate lot state data that indicates that
// a chocolate lot is on the way to this station controller.
//
// It uses a DDS DataReader, with a content filter to receive only updates
// that indicate that it is the next station controller to process the lot.
// 
// Writing ChocolateLotState data:
// ----------------------------
// This application sends chocolate lot state data, announcing that the current
// lot of chocolates is either:
//   1. Waiting to be processed by this station controller
//   2. Being processed by this station controller
//   3. Done being processed by this station controller/ready to be processed
//      by the next station controller.
// 
// For information on the ChocolateRecipe or ChocolateLotState types, please see the
// ChocolateFactory.idl file.  
//
// For information on the quality of service for state data, please see the
// recipe_profiles_multicast.xml file.
//
// Reading Recipe data:
// --------------------
// This application reads recipe data to know which state controller to send
// the chocolate lot to when it is done.
//
// Quality of Service:
// -------------------
// All of the data in this example is modeled as "state data," which means that:
//   1. It is sent reliably (RELIABLE_RELIABILITY_QOS)
//   2. It is made available to late-joining applications as soon as they start
//      (TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS)
//   3. A predetermined amount of state is sent to any late-joiners.  In this 
//      case, applications are only interested in the current state of each
//      chocolate lot (or the current chocolate recipe), which translates to a
//      history with depth = 1, kind = KEEP_LAST_HISTORY_QOS
//

// This example uses instance information to query the middleware's queue for

// There are three options for getting data from RTI Connext DDS:
// 1. Being notified in the application's thread of data arriving.
//    This mechanism has slightly higher latency than option #2, but low
//    latency is not important for this use case.  In addition, this is safer
//    than using option #2, because you do not have to worry about the effect
//    on the middleware's thread.  
//    This uses WaitSet objects to be notified of data arriving.
//    A simple of example of this can be found at: 
//    http://community.rti.com/examples/waitset-status-condition
// 2. Being notified in a listener callback of data arriving.
//    This has lower latency than using a WaitSet, but is more dangerous
//    because you have to worry about not blocking the middleware's thread.
// 3. Polling for data. (Used here)
//    You can call read() or take() at any time to view or remove the data that
//    is currently in the queue. 
//    A simple example of this can be found at:
//    http://community.rti.com/examples/polling-read
