======================

Case + Code Overview
--------------------

This repository is part of Real-Time Innovations' Case + Code project, 
a project to create code for real-world RTI Connext DDS use cases.

The respository contains examples that illustrate a variety of DDS use cases, 
from vehicle tracking to manufacturing and automation.  Some of the use case
examples will be focused on real applications such as air traffic control, 
and some will be focused on deployment scenarios such as connecting real-time
networks over the cloud.

The examples in this repository are meant to illustrate simplified real-world 
uses of the RTI Connext DDS product, focusing on:
- How to represent objects and model data in IDL for each specific use case
- How to tune quality of service (QoS) for use-case-specific requirements such as scalability, latency, or throughput
- How to create applications with both DataWriters and DataReaders

These use case examples should be a stepping stone for creating real 
distributed applications based on RTI Connext DDS. Additional information 
about each use case can be found on [RTI's Case + Code page](www.rti.com/resources/usecases/index.html)
and in the Docs/ directory of the individual use case examples.
