rticonnextdds-usecases
======================

Case + Code Overview
--------------------
This repository is part of Real-Time Innovations' Case + Code project,
a project to create code for real-world RTI Connext DDS use cases.

The repository contains examples that illustrate a variety of DDS use cases, 
from vehicle tracking to manufacturing and automation.  Some of the use case
examples will be focused on real applications such as air traffic control,
and some will be focused on deployment scenarios such as monitoring remote
devices over a wide area network.

The examples in this repository are meant to illustrate simplified real-world
uses of the RTI Connext DDS product, focusing on:
- How to represent objects and model data in IDL for each specific use case
- How to tune quality of service (QoS) for use-case-specific requirements such as scalability, latency, or throughput
- How to create applications with both DataWriters and DataReaders

These use case examples should be a stepping stone for creating real
distributed applications based on RTI Connext DDS. Additional information
about each use case can be found on [RTI's Case + Code page](https://www.rti.com/resources/usecases)
and in the README.md file of the individual use case examples.


RTI Connext DDS Overview
------------------------
RTI Connext DDS software includes the world's leading implementation of the
Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS). DDS is the only
open standard for messaging that supports the unique needs of both enterprise
and real-time systems. Its open interfaces and advanced integration
capabilities slash costs across a system's lifecycle, from initial development
and integration through on-going maintenance and upgrades.
