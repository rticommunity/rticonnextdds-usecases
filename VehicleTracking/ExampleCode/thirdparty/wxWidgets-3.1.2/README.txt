   -------------------- wxWidgets-3.0.3 --------------------

This is a pre-built Release 3.0.3 of wxWidgets - a cross-platform
windowing library.

The full source is available at: http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

This has been pre-built for ease of building the example, but it
can be built against a different wxWidgets release.  The pre-built
libraries have been moved into a directory structure to support
multiple architectures (i86Win32VS2010, etc).

   ---------------------------------------------------

The directory structure is as follows:
 
  include/ 
  include/msvc/
  include/wx
  lib/<platform>/
